# 👋 Hi — I'm Chamuditha Theekshana (Chamu)

**Aspiring Software Engineer • Full-Stack Developer • Hardware-Software Integrator**

I'm a final-year BSc student building real, production-like software systems. I combine **clean front-end UI**, **robust back-end architecture**, and **embedded hardware** integrations (Arduino + RFID) to deliver end-to-end solutions used in real workflows.

## 🔭 Current focus
- Preparing for software engineering internships at leading companies.  
- Building full-stack projects with professional UX + documentation.  
- Strengthening data-structures & algorithms and interview readiness.

## 💼 Highlights / Key Projects
- **Retail POS System** — Complete billing, inventory, and reporting platform (Java, MySQL).  
- **Vehicle Rental Management System** — Booking flow, admin dashboard, availability logic (Java/PHP + MySQL).  
- **RFID Attendance System** — Arduino-based check-in hardware integrated with a desktop/web dashboard (Arduino + Java/Firebase).  
- **Portfolio Website** — Personal site showcasing projects, case studies, and contact info (React/Tailwind).

## 📂 How to explore my work
1. Check my **pinned repos** for flagship projects.  
2. Each repo contains a `README` with setup steps, screenshots, and demo instructions.  
3. Want a quick demo? Email me and I’ll share a runnable build or a short video walkthrough.

## 📈 What makes me different
- I build **hybrid solutions** — UI + APIs + embedded hardware — not just single-page demos.  
- I structure projects like real engineering teams: modular code, documentation, DB schemas, and deployment notes.  
- I focus on **user flows** and **data insights** (dashboards, simple analytics).
